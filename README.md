<img src="images/me_new.jpg" width="250">

Second year student at EPSI Paris La Défense, I am preparing a Bachelor in Application Design and Development. I am taking a new step in my learning by following the [Future in Tech](https://go.raybo.org/tfit) a weekly series powered by [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/) hosted by Senior Staff Instructor [Ray Villalobos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/planetoftheweb).

This series allows me to discover generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, Dall-E*2, Hugging Face, and to exchange with experts in the field. I'm also learning about GitHub Actions, a powerful tool for automating and optimizing my development projects.

You can [watch it on LinkedIn](https://go.raybo.org/tfit-episodes) every Thursday at 2pm ET, 11am PT. The goal of this series is to spark conversations, provide practical tips and resources to help developers work, learn, and tackle challenges related to working in the technology industry.

You have a chance to hear from people who are not just talking about, but building the next generation tools like Open AI and leaders who've worked for and with Fortune 500 companies like Microsoft, Google, LinkedIn,  IBM,  Open AI and more.

I’m learning a lot from this series and I’m excited to apply GitHub actions to my own projects. GitHub actions allow me to automate workflows, run tests, deploy code, and more. They are easy to set up and customize, and they integrate well with other tools and platforms.
